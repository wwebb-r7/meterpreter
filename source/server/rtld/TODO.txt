mipsbe:
  - stat results are completely wrong. endian issue.

general:
  execute / shell is broken. seems to break when requesting a channel / 
  interactive. If execute -f /bin/sleep -a 60 -> it works fine.

  that code should probably be rewritten from scratch using a structure
  and anonymous functions to make it less if then / else if / etc 
  spagetti.
