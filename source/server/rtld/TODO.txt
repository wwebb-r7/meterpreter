mipsbe:
  - stat() results are completely wrong. endian issue.

general:
  execute / shell is broken. seems to break when requesting a channel / 
  interactive. If execute -f /bin/sleep -a 60 -> it works fine.

  that code should probably be rewritten from scratch using a structure
  and anonymous functions to make it less if then / else if / etc 
  spagetti.

  Phdr p_align being 2**21 on x86_64 and 2**16 on mipsbe leads to a lot of
  wasted memory... perhaps there is a better way to allocate than single big
  blobs, or perhaps it's possible to coerce gcc/ld to do 2**12 alignment
  (or whatever is applicable) to reduce the amount of holes in the
  allocations.

  -- 

  ThreadSanitizer / MemorySanitizer / etc support would be good.

  Perhaps moving to http://ellcc.org might be worthwhile?

  Doesn't support address sanitizer :(

  Verify the main thread code is reset during starting the newly
  loaded musl libc entry point code, otherwise work out how to fix
  that in stage3.

  GetLastError() uses a macro and global variable per .o of local_error,
  this needs to be fixed because it's racy, and incorrect in general :>
