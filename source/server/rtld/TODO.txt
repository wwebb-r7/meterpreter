mipsbe:
  - stat results are completely wrong. endian issue.

general:
  execute / shell is broken. seems to break when requesting a channel / 
  interactive. If execute -f /bin/sleep -a 60 -> it works fine.

  Phdr p_align being 2**21 on x86_64 and 2**16 on mipsbe leads to a lot of
  wasted memory... perhaps there is a better way to allocate than single big
  blobs, or perhaps it's possible to coerce gcc/ld to do 2**12 alignment
  (or whatever is applicable) to reduce the amount of holes in the
  allocations.

  that code should probably be rewritten from scratch using a structure
  and anonymous functions to make it less if then / else if / etc 
  spagetti. 

  YYY XXX reset pthread_self / %gs / etc XXX YYY
