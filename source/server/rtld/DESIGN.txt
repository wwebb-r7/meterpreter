                                  Stage 0 for loading meterpreter is the
        /=================\       shellcode requesting the meterpreter 
       /                   \      payload, and allocating the memory for 
      / METERPRETER WORKING \     stage 1 code, and handing execution off 
     /=======================\    to the stage 1 code.
    |                         |   
    |        STAGE 3          |   The stage 1 code acts to bootstrap the libc
    |                         |   environment by decompressing the various
   /===========================\  libraries required, setting up stacks, and
   |                           |  environment (such as AUXV handling) and then
   |         STAGE 2           |  handing execution off to the libc entry point.
   |                           |  
  /=============================\ Stage 2 is the libc code getting itself ready
  |                             | by performing libc related initialization,
  |          STAGE 1            | and then other misc. initialization (such as
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| processing AT_PHDR / etc. stuff). Stage2 then
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| calls the entry point of the stage 3 binary.
  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
  | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | Stage 3 deals with getting meterpreter itself 
  ',. , . , . , . , . , . , . ,.` up and running. To do this, it loads the 
libraries such as pcap, ssl, libsupport, libmetsrv_main. If required, it enables
debugging in the libsupport and libmetsrv_main libraries. 

The POSIX meterpreter utilizes the musl libc environment because it combines the
ld, libdl, and libc environments in a single .so, instead of having various .so's
for different features (which in turn reduces the complexity for us).
